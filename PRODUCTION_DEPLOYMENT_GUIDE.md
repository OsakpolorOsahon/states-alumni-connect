# SMMOWCUB Production Deployment Guide

## 🎯 Pure React + Supabase Production Setup

### Overview
This guide covers production deployment of the SMMOWCUB website using the new Pure React + Supabase architecture. This serverless approach eliminates backend server maintenance while providing enterprise-grade features.

---

## 🏗️ **Architecture Benefits**

### **Pure React + Supabase Stack**
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Vite build system
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with Row Level Security
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with email/password
- **Real-time**: Built-in Supabase real-time subscriptions
- **File Storage**: UploadThing for photos and documents
- **Email**: Resend for transactional emails
- **Deployment**: Replit static deployment

### **Key Advantages**
- **No Backend Server**: Eliminates server maintenance overhead
- **Auto-scaling**: Supabase handles database scaling automatically
- **Built-in Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) protects data
- **Real-time by Default**: Live updates without WebSocket complexity
- **Cost Effective**: Pay-as-you-scale pricing model
- **Developer Experience**: Type-safe APIs auto-generated from schema

## 🚀 **Production Deployment Steps**

### **Step 1: Supabase Production Setup**

#### Database Configuration
1. **Create Production Project**
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Create new project: "SMMOWCUB-Production"
   - Choose closest region to your users
   - Set strong database password

2. **Deploy Database Schema**
   - Go to SQL Editor in Supabase
   - Run the complete `supabase/schema.sql`
   - Verify all tables and policies created

3. **Configure Row Level Security**
   - Verify RLS is enabled on all tables
   - Test policies with different user roles
   - Review security rules in Authentication → Policies

#### Authentication Setup
1. **Configure Auth Settings**
   - Set production Site URL: `https://yourdomain.com`
   - Add redirect URLs for your domain
   - Configure email templates (optional)

2. **Create Secretary Account**
   - Go to Authentication → Users
   - Create secretary user
   - Add member record with secretary role
   - Test secretary login and permissions

### **Step 2: External Services Production Setup**

#### Resend Email Service
1. **Domain Verification**
   - Add your production domain to Resend
   - Configure DNS records (MX, TXT, DKIM)
   - Verify domain authentication

2. **API Key Management**
   - Create production API key
   - Add to environment variables
   - Test email delivery to various providers

#### UploadThing File Storage
1. **Production Configuration**
   - Set file size limits for production
   - Configure CORS for your domain
   - Set up webhook endpoints (if needed)

2. **Security Settings**
   - Restrict upload types to images and PDFs
   - Configure file naming conventions
   - Set up CDN caching rules

#### Google Maps API
1. **API Key Security**
   - Create production API key
   - Restrict to your domain only
   - Enable only required APIs
   - Set up usage quotas and billing alerts

### **Step 3: Replit Production Deployment**

#### Environment Configuration
1. **Production Secrets**
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-key
   UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=your-uploadthing-app-id
   UPLOADTHING_SECRET=your-uploadthing-secret
   VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-maps-key
   ```

2. **Deployment Process**
   - Click **Deploy** in Replit
   - Choose **Static Site** deployment
   - Configure custom domain
   - Enable HTTPS (automatic)

### **Step 4: Domain and SSL Setup**

#### Custom Domain Configuration
1. **DNS Configuration**
   - Point your domain to Replit deployment
   - Set up CNAME records
   - Configure www redirect

2. **SSL Certificate**
   - Replit automatically provisions SSL
   - Verify HTTPS is working
   - Test certificate chain
