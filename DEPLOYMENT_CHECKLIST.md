# SMMOWCUB Complete Deployment Checklist

## üîß **FIXED ISSUES**
- ‚úÖ **Database Connection**: PostgreSQL configured and schema deployed
- ‚úÖ **Firebase Authentication**: API keys configured and working
- ‚úÖ **Email System**: Switched from SendGrid to Resend (more reliable)
- ‚úÖ **Realtime Subscriptions**: Fixed permission denied errors
- ‚úÖ **Application Architecture**: Dual database system (PostgreSQL + Firebase)

## üìã **WHAT YOU STILL NEED TO DO**

### **1. Essential API Keys (Required for Full Functionality)**
You still need these API keys for complete functionality:

#### **UploadThing (File Uploads)**
- **What**: Handles photo uploads and document uploads
- **How**: Go to uploadthing.com ‚Üí Create account ‚Üí Get API keys
- **Keys needed**: `UPLOADTHING_SECRET` and `UPLOADTHING_APP_ID`
- **Impact**: Without this, members can't upload photos or documents

#### **Google Maps (Location Features)**
- **What**: Powers the interactive member location map
- **How**: Go to Google Cloud Console ‚Üí Enable Maps JavaScript API ‚Üí Get API key
- **Key needed**: `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
- **Impact**: Without this, the member location map won't work

### **2. Firebase Security Rules (Critical)**
Your Firebase Firestore database needs security rules configured:

**Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Database ‚Üí Rules ‚Üí Replace with:**

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow public read access to all collections for authenticated users
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### **3. Domain Configuration for Production**

#### **For Firebase (Required)**
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Authorized Domains
2. Add your domain: `yourdomain.com` and `www.yourdomain.com`
3. Remove development URLs when going live

#### **For Resend Email (Required)**
1. Go to Resend Dashboard ‚Üí Domains
2. Add your domain and verify DNS records
3. Update email sender from `noreply@smmowcub.org` to `noreply@yourdomain.com`

## üöÄ **DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS**

### **Option A: Namecheap Hosting + GoDaddy Domain (Your Request)**

#### **Step 1: Domain Setup**
1. In GoDaddy DNS Management:
   - Point A Record to your hosting IP
   - Set CNAME for www to your domain

#### **Step 2: Hosting Setup**
1. Upload built files to Namecheap hosting
2. Set up Node.js environment
3. Configure environment variables
4. Set up SSL certificate

#### **Step 3: Database Setup**
- **Problem**: Namecheap shared hosting doesn't support PostgreSQL
- **Solution**: Use external database service like:
  - Neon.tech (PostgreSQL) - Free tier available
  - PlanetScale (MySQL) - Would require schema conversion
  - Keep using Replit's database and connect externally

#### **Step 4: Build Process**
```bash
npm run build
# Upload dist/ folder to Namecheap
# Upload server files
# Configure Node.js on Namecheap
```

### **Option B: Replit Deployment (Recommended)**
**Pros**: 
- No configuration needed
- Database already set up
- Environment variables already configured
- SSL automatically handled
- Easier maintenance

**Steps**:
1. Click "Deploy" button in Replit
2. Configure custom domain in Replit Dashboard
3. Update DNS in GoDaddy to point to Replit

### **Option C: Vercel/Netlify (Modern Alternative)**
**Pros**:
- Better performance
- Free tier available
- Easy deployment from Git
- Built-in SSL and CDN
