# Login Flow Test Guide

## Steps to Test Login

1. **Open browser console** (F12) to see debug logs
2. **Go to login page** - Should show "Sign In" button (not stuck on "Connecting...")
3. **Enter credentials** - bikajaw793@mvpmedix.com / [password]
4. **Click Sign In** - Watch console for these logs:
   - "Starting login attempt for: bikajaw793@mvpmedix.com"
   - "Starting sign in process for: bikajaw793@mvpmedix.com" 
   - "User authenticated successfully"
   - "Setting user in context: bikajaw793@mvpmedix.com"
   - "Authentication complete, returning success"
   - "Login result: {success: true, message: '...'}"
   - "Login successful, showing toast and navigating..."
   - "Navigating to dashboard..."

5. **Expected Result**: Should redirect to /dashboard immediately

## If Login Still Fails:

1. Check console for specific error messages
2. Verify Supabase environment variables are set properly
3. Check if user exists in Supabase database
4. Test with different credentials
