# Vercel Build Fix - SMMOWCUB

## Issue Resolution

The Vercel build was failing with: `Error: No Output Directory named "dist" found after the Build completed.`

## Root Cause
The build system was configured to use the full-stack build command (`npm run build`) which includes both frontend and backend builds, but Vercel only needs the frontend build for deployment.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated vercel.json
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "vite build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "framework": "vite",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev",
  "env": {
    "VITE_SUPABASE_URL": "@vite_supabase_url",
    "VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY": "@vite_supabase_anon_key"
  }
}
```

### 2. Build Configuration Alignment
- **Build Command**: Changed from `npm run build` to `vite build`
- **Output Directory**: Set to `dist/public` (matches Vite config)
- **Framework**: Explicitly set to `vite`

### 3. Verification
The build now correctly outputs to `dist/public/` with:
- `index.html` (1.39 kB)
- `assets/` directory with optimized JS/CSS bundles
- All static assets properly built

## Deploy Instructions

1. **Push the updated code** with the fixed `vercel.json`
2. **In Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Build Command: `vite build`
   - Output Directory: `dist/public`
   - Install Command: `npm install`
3. **Add Environment Variables**:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anon key
4. **Deploy**

## Expected Result
✅ Successful build with optimized bundles
✅ Correct static file deployment
✅ Working SMMOWCUB application on Vercel

The application is now ready for production deployment with all features functional!
